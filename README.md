# 👁️ Eye Disease Classification System

![Demo Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghreeb1/Eye_Disease.Classifiction/master/templates/1.png)

A deep learning application for detecting ocular diseases from retinal images using PyTorch and Flask.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Multi-disease detection**: Classifies multiple common eye conditions.
- 🌐 **Web interface**: User-friendly image upload and result display.
- ⚙️ **Pre-trained model**: Ready-to-use model file `eye_disease_model.pth`.
- 📓 **Jupyter notebook**: Full training pipeline in `eye_disease.ipynb`.
